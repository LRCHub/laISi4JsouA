Man
I find myself more and more, increasingly
On a vibe like this, y'know
And you at home might not know it but
I like to try
And spend most of my day on a vibe like this
If I can just want you wherever you are
To take your time with
Me - spend the next four
Minutes and enjoy yourself, know-what-Imean?
'Cause it's a vibe, it's a vibe
Do do do do, do do, do do
Do do do do, do do, do do
Do do do do, do do, do do
Well all right, yeah
Tell me a story of deep delight
I got a feeling I'ma meet my wife
I'm happy I woke up feeling fine today
Ooh yeah
I'ma make it so I'm never gon' lose you
You know that I'm always coming back to you
Ain't that so rich got it made-in-the-shade
Do do do do, do do, do do
Do do do do, do do, do do
Do do do do, do do, do do
Well all right, yeah
I'm on a lazy river let's get away somehow
As long as we're together
Nothing gon' hold us down
We gon' keep this boat rowing
I live to make you laugh
I lost where I was going
'Cause I love where I'm at
There's a warm shower running inside me
I decided I'ma treat myself kindly
Ain't that so rich got it made-in-the-shade
Ooh yeah
Do do do do, do do, do do
Do do do do, do do, do do
Do do do do, do do, do do
Well all right, yeah
I wanna love with reckless abandon
I'm talking 'bout infinite compassion
I don't ever wanna miss a lovely day
Lovely day
I won't let nothing come into my moment
When I start thinking about
The possible distractions
If ever I start giving my
Energy to some hating
Or if I'm getting concerned about
Who is the fastest that ain't important
I wanna learn to be happy
I wanna learn to go hush
Oh hush, oh hush, oh hush
Alright, alright, alright okay, okay, okay
Alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright, alright
Yeah, let's go on back to the chorus now
Do do do do, do do, do do
Do do do do, do do, do do
Do do do do, do do, do do
Well all right, yeah
You don't gotta wait for me
I'll be right here
You don't gotta wait for me
I'll be right here
You don't gotta wait for me
I'll be right here
You don't gotta wait for me
I'll be right here
You don't gotta wait for me
I'll be right here
You don't gotta wait for me
I'll be right here you don't gotta wait
(you ain't gotta wait
You ain't gotta wait) for me
(You ain't gotta wait) I'll be right
Here (you ain't gotta wait)
You don't gotta wait
(you ain't gotta wait
You ain't gotta wait) for me
I'll be right here right here next to you
